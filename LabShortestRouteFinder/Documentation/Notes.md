## ViewModel

GraphViewModel and RouteViewModel has to be synchronized in that way any changes on the Routes should be displayed on the Graph.

In order to keep both ViewModels synchronized will be done by using a **share data source** in a central MainViewModel. This approach allows each ViewModel to manage its own view-specific logic while still being notified of changes in the shared data.

Solution: Use `MainViewModel` as a shared data source with Change Notification.

- **Shared Data Collection** in `MainViewModel`
	Store the central data in `MainViewModel` as `ObservableCollection<Route> Routes` and `ObservableCollection<CityNode> Cities`.`
	objects so changes are automatically propagated to the ViewModels.
- **Use `INotifyPropertyChanged`**
	By exposing collections as `ObsevableCollection` and implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged`, you can keep track of changes and notify dependent ViewModels of changes to the shared data.`
- **Bind both ViewModels to `MainViewModel`**
	Both `GraphViewModel` and `RouteViewModel` will bind to the shared data in `MainViewModel` to keep the views synchronized.`

### `RouteViewModel` and `GraphViewModel` Interaction` 
Now, both `RouteViewModel` and `GraphViewModel` will be constructed with a reference to `MainViewModel`. This way, they can observe changes in the shared data.

- **`RouteViewModel`**
	- `RouteViewModel` will bind to the `Routes` collection in `MainViewModel` to display the list of routes.
	- `RouteViewModel` will also have a method to add a new route to the `Routes` collection in `MainViewModel`.
- **`GraphViewModel`**
	- `GraphViewModel` will bind to the `Cities` collection in `MainViewModel` to display the graph.
	- `GraphViewModel` will also have a method to add a new city to the `Cities` collection in `MainViewModel`.

### Initialize and Bind ViewModels in `MainViewModel`
In `MainViewModel`, you will initialize both `RouteViewModel` and `GraphViewModel` and bind them to the shared data.

## **Summary base structure**
- **Centralized Data**: `MainViewModel` holds the shared data (`Cities` and `Routes`).
- **Separate ViewModels**: `RouteViewModel` and `GraphViewModel` access the shared data by referencing `MainViewModel`.
- **Data Synchronization**: Updates in `MainViewModel` collections are automatically reflected in both views due to `ObservableCollection` and change notification mechanisms.
- **Shared Data Collection** in MainViewModel
- **Use INotifyPropertyChanged**
- **Bind both ViewModels to MainViewModel**
- **RouteViewModel and GraphViewModel Interaction**
- **Initialize and Bind ViewModels in MainViewModel**

### Make Changes on the list reflect in the Graph.
To make the changes in the ListViewControl reflect in the GraphViewControl, particularly when changing the name of the start position, you’ll need to ensure that:

1. **Two-Way Binding** is set up for the `Name` property in `ListViewControl``.
2. **Property Change Notification** is implemented for the `Name` property in the `CityNode` model. This will ensure that when a property changes in the model, all views bound to that property are updated.

### **Summary**
Changes on the  locations names in the ListViewControl will be reflected in the GraphViewControl by setting up two-way binding and implementing property change notification.

### **Next Requirements**
- **Change the distance** between two cities in the ListViewControl.
- **Add a new route** to the list of routes in the ListViewControl.
- **Remove a route** from the list of routes in the ListViewControl.
- **Load routes from a file** and display them in the ListViewControl.
- **Use X and Y coordinates** to represent the position of cities in the GraphViewControl.
- **X and Y coordinates** should be editable in the ListViewControl.
- X and Y coordinates should be updated in the GraphViewControl when changed in the ListViewControl.
- X and Y coordinates should be validated to ensure they are within the bounds of the GraphViewControl.
- X and Y coordinates should be saved to a file when changed in the ListViewControl.
- X and Y are windows coordinates and should be derived from the city GPS coordinates when loaded from a file.
- Map the window coordinates to GPS coordinates when saving to a file.
- Find the shortest route between two cities in the GraphViewControl.
- Find cycles in the GraphViewControl.
- Find the shortest cycle in the GraphViewControl.
- Draw the shortest route between two cities in the GraphViewControl with chosen color.
